# Claims and OBJECT:SOCIAL(OS)
I am working on a project.
My name is Pirasath Luxchumykanthan, and I come from Denmark.
I want to do a project that can grow with your help if you can develop or help with something.
My email is hello@object.social.
My goal is to create a project that everyone can enjoy.
The project does not have any guidelines; it does not cover porn or arms sales, or illegal activity.
We must respect laws and regulations around the world.
The company is called OBJECT:SOCIAL ApS
